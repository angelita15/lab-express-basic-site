    Tardar Sauce (April 4, 2012 â€“ May 14, 2019), nicknamed Grumpy Cat, was an American Internet celebrity cat.
    She was known for her permanently "grumpy" facial appearance, which was caused by an underbite and feline dwarfism.
    She came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on September 22, 2012, 
    on social news website Reddit by Bryan Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha Bundesen.
